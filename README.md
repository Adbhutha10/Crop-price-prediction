  - Cleans and prepares real-world crop price datasets  
  - Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Trains models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and others  
  - Fine-tuning and evaluation for optimal accuracy

- 📈 **Visualizations**  
  - Graphs to explore data trends and evaluate predictions  
  - Comparison of actual vs predicted prices

- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**  
  - Metrics: **MAE**, **RMSE**, **R² Score**
